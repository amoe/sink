revision log

  0.0  2007 August 4   First moderately complete prototype.  Uses a somewhat
                         haphazard mixture of primitive (meta-language) and
                         library (object-language) implementations of derived
                         features.  Only sporadically tested, and some feature
                         implementations consciously do not fully conform to
                         the R-1RK.

  0.1  2007 August 5   Disables most primitive implementations of derived
                         core features, and most library implementations
                         whatsoever, clearing the way for more systematic
                         testing of core derivations from the report.  Some
                         of the disabled primitive implementations are
                         retained in comments (but that needn't imply
                         they're correct).

  0.2                  Adds library implementations of all derived core
                         features.

  0.3                  Replaces primitive implementations of general
                         arithmetic applicatives (+ - * /) with primitive
                         implementations of binary applicatives and library
                         generalizations using reduce.
