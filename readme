These source files collectively form a Scheme program that interprets a
language that is almost, but not quite, Kernel.  The program is called
SINK, which is an acronym for Scheme-based Interpreter for Not-quite Kernel.

The interpreter is meant to have been written in unextended R5RS Scheme.
Incidental file "subfiles/script.scm", which is not part of the interpreter
proper, uses extensions in MzScheme.

Platform

  Because the program is written in R5RS Scheme, its Kernel-error-handling
  facilities rely on dynamic-wind to catch errors occurring in native Scheme
  procedures.  Unfortunately, this behavior is not actually spelled out in the
  R5RS, and some implementors of R5RS Scheme have seen fit not to integrate
  dynamic-wind gracefully with their error handling.  Consequently, under some
  implementations of R5RS Scheme an error in a primitive (such as dividing by
  zero) will cause the entire SINK interpreter to abend.  The program was
  developed under MzScheme, where dynamic-wind catches errors as expected (or
  at least it did, as of version 103 of MzScheme that was used during
  development).

Files in the home directory

  readme

    This file.

  rev-log

    A summary of the revision history of the program.

  sink.scm

    The primary source file for running SINK under Scheme interactive mode.
    Loading this file creates the interpreter by loading all secondary source
    files in the proper sequence, and outputs a startup message identifying
    the program and giving instructions on how to run it.

  sink.bat

    An MS-DOS batch file for running SINK directly under the MS-DOS prompt,
    bypassing Scheme interactive mode.

  subfiles/

    Directory containing all the secondary source files.

  test/

    Directory containing miscellaneous (not-quite-)Kernel source files for
    testing.  Source files that are pure Kernel have file type ".krn", those
    that are not (because they use "%" instead of "#") have file type ".snk".
