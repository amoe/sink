;
; Pairs in the interpreted language ("Kernel") are a different data type from
; pairs in the meta-language (Scheme).  The interpreted-language type is
; called "kernel-pair".  Outside of this file, types pair and kernel-pair
; cannot be assumed to be identical, nor can they be assumed to be disjoint.
;
; The interpreted language has both mutable and immutable kernel-pairs.
; Their subtypes are called respectively "mutable" and "immutable".
; Private to this file, immutables are disjoint from pairs, while two
; different implementations are possible for mutables, one in which mutables
; are actually pairs (unbeknownst to the rest of the interpreter), the other
; in which they too are disjoint from pairs.
;
; When a procedure for kernel-pairs is cognate to one for pairs, it is named
; by adding prefix "kernel-" to the Scheme name:  kernel-cons, kernel-car,
; kernel-cdr, kernel-caar, etc.
;
; The only constructor of immutables is copy-es-immutable, which returns an
; immutable copy of a kernel-pair and all other kernel-pairs reachable from
; it without passing through any non-kernel-pair.  Consequently, it is not
; possible for an immutable to have a mutable as its kernel-car or kernel-cdr.
;
; Type kernel-list differs from type list both by using kernel-pairs instead of
; pairs, and by allowing cycles.  An "improper kernel-list" doesn't have to be
; null-terminated, therefore all Kernel values are improper kernel-lists.
; Similarly, every Kernel value is a kernel-tree; but Scheme trees aren't used
; in the interpreter, so kernel-trees are called simply "trees".
;
;
; Implementing mutables disjointly is more expensive than implementing
; immutables that way, because there is usually just one immutable copy of an
; algorithm, but during evaluation of that one copy, many mutable argument
; lists are constructed.  On the other hand, if mutables are represented by
; pairs, it is appallingly easy for code elsewhere in the interpreter to treat
; Kernel structures as if they were Scheme structures, without the bug being
; detected for a long time.  Both implementations have been provided, one in
; file "subfiles/kernel-pair-disjoint.scm" and the other in file
; "subfiles/kernel-pair-overlapping.scm"; the file loaded by the interpreter,
; called "subfiles/kernel-pair.scm", is a copy of one or the other version.
;
; This is the disjoint version of the type.  A mutable kernel-pair is an object
; with type 'mutable and attribute 'kar, 'kdr, and 'content, where 'content is
; a pair whose car and cdr are returned by 'kar and 'kdr.  An immutable
; kernel-pair is an object with type 'immutable and attributes 'kar and 'kdr.

;
; Constructs a procedure that takes as its sole argument a possibly-cyclic
; structure composed from some pair-like primitive data type, and returns a
; list of nodes of the structure (i.e., pair-like entities) whose revisits
; should be pruned during traversal of the structure.
;
; The precise condition that should be satisfied by the result is that the
; listed revisits are a minimal set sufficient to minimize a traversal of the
; structure.
;   "Sufficient to minimize a traversal" means that, if the structure were
; traversed, checking each node against the revisits-list; and at the first
; position where a listed node is visited, traversal would continue past it to
; its descendants, but at other positions where it occurs, traversal would not
; continue past it; then this traversal would visit every node of the
; structure at least once, and would revisit only nodes on the revisits-list.
;   "Minimal set" means that if any member of the revisits-list were removed,
; then it would no longer have this property, i.e., it would no longer be
; sufficient to minimize a traversal.
;
; The purpose of this condition is to all clients to preserve structural
; isomorphism.  This is a strictly more difficult task than merely preventing
; infinite traversal of cyclic structures.  For example, commands
;   ($define! x (list 1 2 3))
;   (set-car! x (cdr x))
; would produce acyclic structure  (#1=(2 3) . #1#)  whose revisit-list would
; be a singleton list of node #1#.  Merely to prevent infinite traversals,
; it would suffice to check each node against its ancestors; but that would
; not detect the redundancy in this example, so that any structural
; transformation based on such an algorithm could not be expected to produce
; a structurally isomorphic result.

; Constructs a procedure that takes as its sole argument a possibly-cyclic
; structure composed from some pair-like primitive data type, and returns
; a structurally isomorphic copy of its evaluation structure, optionally
; performing some transformation on leaf nodes during the copy.
;
; There will be three such procedures constructed:
; copy-es-immutable, copy-es, and scheme-read-object->kernel.
;
; The evaluation structure of a value (under a given pair-like primitive type)
; is the structure whose start is the value itself, and whose members are all
; objects reachable from the start by following only car and cdr references
; (of the given pair-like primitive type).  If the value is not of the
; chosen pair-like type, then the value itself is the only object of the
; data structure.
;
; Arguments:
;     in-pair?       --- predicate for the input pair-like type
;     in-car, in-cdr --- accessors for the input pair-like type
;     make-record    --- constructs an alist record (see below)
;     out-cons       --- constructs a copy of a non-pruned parent node
;     xform-leaf     --- transformation to perform on leaves when copying
;
; First, compiles an alist whose keys are those in-pairs in the input
; structure whose cyclic revisiting must be pruned during traversal.  For
; each of these in-pairs, make-record constructs an alist record whose key
; is the in-pair, whose cadr is an out-pair, and whose cddr is a pair whose
; elements determine the out-car and out-cdr of the out-pair.  (Depending on
; representations, the cadr and cddr might actually be the same object.)  Then
; the in-pairs of the input structure are traversed a second time, creating
; out-pairs for non-pruned mutables using out-cons, and setting the elements
; of the previously constructed out-pairs for pruned in-pairs.  When the
; elements of a pruned out-pair are to be set, its content pair is separated
; out and the cddr of its record is set to nil, to prevent infinite recursion.
