; keyed variables ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
; Keyed variables are (from the Kernel programmer's perspective) bound and
; accessed via matched sets of combiners --- one binder and one accessor for
; each "variable".  There are two kinds of keyed variables:  dynamic keyed
; variables, which are bound in contexts, and static keyed variables, which are
; bound in environments (but are entirely separate from symbolic variables).
; Internally, each context or environment holds a list of key/value pairs; the
; holding object regulates access to the alist, but the actual operations
; are handled by tools provided here --- key assignment, alist construction,
; and lookup.
;
; The keys are integers.  Once an alist is in a context/environment, it is
; never mutated.
;
; There is no need for the alists or the keys to be encapsulated, because the
; purpose of encapsulation is to prevent Kernel programs from violating
; abstraction barriers on the objects they manipulate, and Kernel programs
; are never allowed to directly touch the alists or keys.
