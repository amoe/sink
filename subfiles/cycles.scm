; Kernel treats cyclic structures of kernel-pairs (such as cyclic lists) as
; first-class objects, by guaranteeing that each standard combiner will handle
; cyclic structures in finite time whenever that behavior is consistent with
; the intended semantics of the combiner.
;
; The tools in this file help SINK to handle cyclic structures.  However,
; despite the availability of these tools, at last check SINK did not (yet)
; handle cyclic structures in all cases required by Kernel.
;
; The tools here do not use any internal knowledge of the kernel-pair type.
; Cycle-related tools that do use internal knowledge of that type are in file
; "subfiles/kernel-pair.scm".
;
; A kernel-tree is called simply a "tree", because the interpreter has no
; occasion to use Scheme trees.  A kernel-pair may be visited more than once
; during normal (left-to-right, depth first) traversal of a tree without
; constituting a cycle, so long as the revisited kernel-pair isn't a
; descendant of itself.
;
; Even if all kernel-pairs were known to be represented by pairs (which, if it
; were true, should only be known in "subfiles/kernel-pair.scm"), it would be
; necessary to handle them with tongs in Scheme, because Scheme doesn't grant
; first-class status to cyclic pair-structures.  Notably, the argument list of
; a procedure cannot be cyclic.  In Kernel, of course, there is no difficulty
; in using a cyclic argument list (or operand list).

;
; Given a value to be construed as an improper kernel-list, returns a list
; of the following four statistics about the value:
;
;   p = the number of kernel-pairs in the improper list.
;   n = the number of nils in the improper list
;         (1 if proper and finite, else 0).
;   a = the number of kernel-pairs in the acyclic prefix of the improper list.
;   c = the number of kernel-pairs in the cycle of the improper list
;         (0 if not a cyclic list).
;
; The algorithm here is linear-time, requiring two passes through the improper
; list, of which the first pass may traverse the improper list for up to twice
; its length, and the second pass traverses it for its length.
;  (1) In the first pass, aux, we determine either that the list is acyclic,
; or the length of its cycle; to detect a cycle, each kernel-pair at position n
; in the list is compared for eq?-ness to the kernel-pair at the most recent
; power-of-two index.  Each kernel-pair is compared to only one other, and we
; can't overshoot the beginning of the cycle by more than a factor of two, so
; this pass takes time linear in the number of kernel-pairs.  If there's no
; cycle, we're done.
;  (2) A second pass, aux2, determines where the cycle begins, by comparing
; each kernel-pair starting from the beginning of the list to the kernel-pair
; displaced to its right by exactly the cycle length (which we know, from the
; first pass).
;
; An alternative algorithm would be to use encapsulated integer marks on
; kernel-pairs; one would then require two passes of just the length of the
; improper list.  That algorithm would have to be in file
; "subfiles/kernel-pair.scm", since it would use private information about
; kernel-pair.  However, even if one did that, it would save less than fifty
; percent in traversal length, and the traversal steps could be significantly
; more expensive since they would involve modifying the encapsulated mark
; fields.  That's not even getting in to questions of reentrance and
; parallelization.
