; revision and date tracking ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;
; This is just a simple device for coordinating decentralized information on
; revision numbers and dates, so that when modifying just one source file,
; resultant changes to revision information are localized within that file.
;
; Each source file should call procedures set-version and set-revision-date.
;
; set-revision-date simply takes a year number, month number (1--12), and day
; number (1--31).
;
; set-version takes any number of arguments, each of which is a list whose
; first element is a real, and whose second element is an integer.
;
;   The first, real element is a version number that the file supports.  The
; version number of the entire program is the largest version number that is
; supported by *all* of the source files (precisely, the largest version
; number supported by all of the calls to set-version).
;
;   The second, integer element is a modification count.  For each version
; number, the *sum* of all modification counts is maintained.  Whichever
; version is chosen as the largest supported by all files, its total
; modification count is reported as a suffix to the version number reported by
; procedure get-version.
;
;   When a source file is modified, increment the modification counts for all
; its supported versions.  Some earlier version numbers may no longer be
; supported by the file in its new form, in which case, delete those version
; numbers from the list.  When a newly supported version number is added, its
; modification count should be zero.
;   When a source file is certified for a later version without being modified,
; the new version number is added with modification count zero, without
; changing the modification counts for versions already supported.  In this
; case the revision date doesn't have to be changed.
;   When modifying a source file without adding any new version number to it,
; there is no need to increment the modification cound of any version number
; that the interpreter as a whole has yet to achieve.
