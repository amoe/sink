;
; Encapsulated objects in the interpreted language are represented by
; procedures.  The representing procedure takes a symbol as argument, and
; returns one of several fields.  Internally, it's a dispatch procedure.
;
; The point of the exercise is to achieve guaranteed encapsulation of these
; objects *in the interpreted language*.  The interpreter source code is
; supposed to follow stylistic rules, which can be checked because the
; interpreter source code is finite, and it is then technically impossible
; for a Kernel program to violate the encapsulation of the objects.  The
; essential point is that a Kernel program cannot directly require that
; a procedure be called (procedure being a type in the Scheme meta-language,
; not in the interpreted Kernel language), and therefore the Kernel program
; is limited in its manipulations of encapsulated objects to those specific
; manipulations for which Kernel tools are provided.
;
; Every object has two fields, 'type and 'name.
;   'type is a symbol that names the object's type.
;   'name is a list, whose car is either #f, meaning the object is unnameable;
; or #t, meaning the object can be named but hasn't been yet; or a symbol or
; string, which is then the object's name.  The cdr of the list is initially
; nil, but could later be altered via designate-origin, which see.
; 
;
; For example, here's how one would idiomatically set up an object type 'foo
; that is nameable and has attributes 'bar and 'quux.
;
;     (define make-foo
;       (lambda (bar quux)
;         (let ((name  (list #t)))
;           (lambda (message)
;             (case message
;               ((type) 'foo)
;               ((name) name)
;               ((bar)  bar)
;               ((quux) quux))))))
;
;     (define foo? (make-object-type-predicate 'foo))
;
; Sufficient accessors should be provided that clients never have to know that
; encapsulated objects are dispatch procedures; for example, if clients should
; have the ability to access the 'bar and 'quux attributes of a foo,
;
;     (define get-foo-bar  (lambda (x) (x 'bar)))
;     (define get-foo-quux (lambda (x) (x 'quux)))

; Designates a particular other object to which this object should suggest its

; and should be another object that is in some sense the foundation for this
; object, such as the underlying combiner of an applicative.  (If there weren't
; already such a foundational relationship, the designation would prevent the
; other object from being garbage collected before this one.)  It often happens
; that the predecessor object is created just to found its successor, and is
; never directly bound by a symbol, so that this facility becomes the most
; likely way for the predecessor to receive a relevant name.
